- 👋 Hi, I am 43 year old father of 1 awesome son. Our better half is not on this plane of existance anymore. Just trying to work to make a path for my son to not worry about what could have been or what you don't have but focus on what you can get out of this life of yours.
- 👀 As long as I'm learning something, I figure I'm OK - it's a decent day.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that “Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming "Wow! What a Ride!” ― Hunter S. Thompson
